Feature: Countersigning declaration page for the operator (Verify switched off)

@OLCS-21678
Scenario: New countersigning declaration page for the operator (Verify switched off)

Given verify has been switched "off"
When I have a "goods" "GB" partial application
And i add a transport manager
And the transport manager is not the owner
When i submit the application
Then the 'Awaiting operator review' verify off page is displayed
And the application status is "With operator"
