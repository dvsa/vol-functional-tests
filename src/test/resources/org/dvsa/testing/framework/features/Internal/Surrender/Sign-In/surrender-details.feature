Feature: View Surrender Menu and details on Internal

  Background:
    Given i have a valid "public" "standard_national" licence with an open case and bus reg
    And my application to surrender is under consideration

  Scenario: Surrender details should be displayed appropriately on Internal verify
    And a caseworker views the surrender details
    Then any open cases should be displayed
    And any open bus registrations should be displayed
    And tick boxes should be displayed
    Then the Surrender button should not be clickable
    And the change history has the surrender under consideration


#  Scenario: Surrender after closing cases & bus Reg verify
#    When the caseworker checks the case and bus reg is visible in surrenders
#    And the open case and bus reg is closed
#    And a caseworker views the surrender details
#    And the tick boxes are checked
#    And the Surrender button is clicked
#    Then the licence should be surrendered
