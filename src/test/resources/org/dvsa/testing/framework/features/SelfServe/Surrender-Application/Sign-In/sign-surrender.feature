  Background:

    And i choose to surrender my licence

  Scenario: Sign with gov sign in - check that surrender has been created
    When I can navigate to gov sign in
    And I sign in to gov sign in to complete the process
    Then the post gov sign in page is displayed
    And the surrender status is "Surrender under consideration"
