Feature: 1 - Publications generate on LGV related changes and regression

  Scenario Outline: Publications generate and display correctly on both apps. (LGV variation increase)
    Given i have a valid "goods" "<licenceType>" licence
    And i create and submit an operating centre variation with "<HGVs>" hgvs and "<LGVs>" lgvs
    When the corresponding publication is generated and published
    Then the publication is visible via self serve search
    And the "New Variation" "<variationType>" publication text is correct with "<HGVs>" hgvs and "<LGVs>" lgvs

    Examples:
    | licenceType            | HGVs | LGVs | variationType |
#    | standard_international | 5    | 5    | LGV           |
#    | standard_international | 8    | 0    | HGV           |
    | standard_international | 8    | 5    | HGV and LGV   |
#    | standard_national      | 8    | 0    | HGV           |
